Here are my recommended resources for learning React as an Android dev:

1. JavaScript/TypeScript Foundation

javascript.info (free) - Comprehensive but skip to "JavaScript language" sections you need
TypeScript Handbook (official docs) - Since you know Kotlin's type system, start here: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html
Time: Skim through, reference as needed (don't get stuck here)

2. React Core Learning

Official React docs (https://react.dev) - BEST resource in 2025. They rewrote it with modern hooks-first approach. Start with "Learn React" section
Scrimba's React course (free/paid) - Interactive coding in browser, great for hands-on learning
Net Ninja's React playlist (YouTube, free) - Clear, concise videos if you prefer video learning

3. Practice Projects

Frontend Mentor (https://frontendmentor.io) - Real-world UI challenges with designs provided
Build a weather app - Classic starter: fetch API data, display it (like your Android apps but web)
Todo app with localStorage - Covers state management, persistence basics

4. When You're Ready

Next.js tutorial (https://nextjs.org/learn) - Official tutorial, teaches modern React patterns
Josh Comeau's blog (https://joshwcomeau.com) - Deep dives into React concepts, excellent writing

5. React Native Bridge (optional)

React Native docs (https://reactnative.dev) - Once you know React, this is straightforward
You'll recognize many Android concepts (like Views, navigation patterns)


My recommended order:

Spend 2-3 days on TypeScript basics (just syntax)
Go straight to react.dev official tutorial - build the tic-tac-toe game
Build one small project from scratch (weather app or similar)
Try Next.js tutorial to see modern React
Build something that connects to a backend (your own or a free API)

Avoid:

Udemy courses over 3 years old (React changes fast)
Tutorial hell - build your own projects after learning basics
Learning Redux initially - you don't need it yet

The official React docs are genuinely the best starting point in 2025. They're written for modern React and assume you're learning hooks from day one.
Start there and you'll be building functional React apps within 2-3 weeks.
