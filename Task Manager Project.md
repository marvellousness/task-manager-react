# Project: Task Manager with Android Companion

A full-stack task management app with web (Next.js) and Android sync capability.
Why this project:

Connects to your Android skills (you can build the Android version too)
Covers all essential React/Next.js concepts
Portfolio-worthy for full-stack positions
Practical - you'll actually use it


## Phase 1: React Basics (Week 1-2)
Build: Simple Task List (client-only)
Features:

Add/delete/complete tasks
Filter (all/active/completed)
LocalStorage persistence
Basic styling with Tailwind CSS

What you'll learn:

Components & props
useState, useEffect hooks
Event handling
Array operations (map, filter)
Browser storage

Output: Working React app (no backend yet)


## Phase 2: Next.js Basics (Week 3-4)
Upgrade to: Next.js with API Routes
New features:

Convert to Next.js App Router
API routes for CRUD operations
JSON file or SQLite database
Server-side rendering
Separate pages (home, task detail, settings)

What you'll learn:

File-based routing
API routes (your backend!)
Server vs Client components
Data fetching patterns
Form handling with Server Actions

Output: Full-stack web app with persistence

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
Add production features:
Backend:

User authentication (NextAuth.js or Clerk)
PostgreSQL database (free tier on Vercel/Supabase)
Task categories/tags
Due dates & priorities

Frontend:

Dashboard with stats
Search & advanced filters
Drag-and-drop reordering
Dark mode toggle
Responsive design

What you'll learn:

Authentication flows
Database integration (Prisma ORM)
State management (Context API or Zustand)
Advanced React patterns
Deployment

Output: Production-ready web app


## Phase 4: Android Integration (Optional)
Build Android companion app:

Retrofit for API calls to your Next.js backend
Jetpack Compose UI (you already know this!)
Offline-first with Room database
Sync with web version

This completes your full-stack loop!


# Tech Stack Recommendation

Backend: Next.js API Routes
Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase free tier)
ORM: Prisma
Auth: Clerk (easiest) or NextAuth
Deployment: Vercel (free, one-click)
